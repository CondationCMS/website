# Template engines

We provide a [default template engine](/documentation/templates-and-themes/default-template-engine), so in most cases installing a template engine module is not necessary. 
But if you need some special features or want to use your common syntax we provide implementations of the most commonly used template engines.

## Thymeleaf

[Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/) is probably the most frequently used template engine in the Java environment.

## Pebble

[Pebble](https://pebbletemplates.io/) is a template engine inspired by [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/).

## Apache Freemarker

[Apache Freemarker](https://freemarker.apache.org) is one of the older representatives of the template engines, but is still widely used.

For a better view, we use the square bracket syntax in freemarker.

## Apache Velocity

[Apache Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org) is one of the older representatives of the template engines, but is still widely used.

## Jinja

[Jinja](https://github.com/HubSpot/jinjava/) a template engine under developing by HubSpot. Syntax is similar to pebble.
