# Shortcodes

With shortcodes it is possible to extend the rendering of the markdown content.

Shortcodes are helpful for extension and module developers. 

The youtube integration for example uses shortcodes to provided simple integration of videos inside content or template.

```markdown
\[\[video type="youtube" id="y0sF5xhGreA" title="Everybody loves little cats" /\]\]
```
