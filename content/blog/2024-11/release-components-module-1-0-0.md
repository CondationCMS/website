Weâ€™re excited to announce the release of the Components Module for CondationCMS! ðŸŽ‰ This new module introduces reusable components, providing a streamlined way for developers to create and manage modular elements across a site.

ðŸ‘‰ [Learn more about the Components Module](/modules/components-module)


## What Does It Do?
The Components Module establishes a standardized approach to building reusable components. Whether youâ€™re a theme developer, extension developer, or module developer, you can now easily create components that can be integrated into a siteâ€™s design and functionality.

For site developers, the module also offers flexibility: you can override templates of components provided by themes, tailoring them to your specific needs without altering the original source.


## Templates: How Do They Work?

### Theme and Site Components

These components use the site's default template engine to render their template files, ensuring seamless integration with the site's look and feel.

### Module and Extension Components

Module and extension developers can define how their components render. Since these developers might not know which template engine the site uses, they can implement custom rendering logic to generate HTML independently of the site's template engine.

This flexibility empowers all developers to create components that work harmoniously within CondationCMS, regardless of the underlying architecture.



#### Ready to Explore?

We can't wait to see what you'll build with the Components Module. ðŸš€

Have fun trying it out, and let us know your thoughts!

CU,
The CondationCMS Team
