Today we released the first version of the [video-module](/modules/video-module).

It provides a ShortCode to integrate a video from [youtube](https://youtube.com/) or [vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) into markdown content or template code.

```markdown
\[\[video type="youtube" id="y0sF5xhGreA" title="Everybody loves little cats" /\]\]
```

have fun trying it out!
